# **Jelajah Buku: A Book Search Web App with N-Gram and LSTM Autocomplete**

## **Overview**
Jelajah Buku is a web app designed to enhance book searches using N-Gram and LSTM-based autocomplete. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide faster, more accurate book recommendations.

## **Features**
🔹 N-Gram Autocomplete – Predicts the next word using perplexity scoring.

🔹 LSTM Autocomplete – Captures longer text patterns for context-aware suggestions.

🔹 Search up to 10 book titles with metadata (authors, publication year, etc.).

## **Tech Stack**
✅ Backend: Flask – for seamless algorithm integration.

✅ Frontend: HTML & CSS – for an intuitive user experience.

✅ Dataset: Kaggle’s Book Metadata – including titles, authors, and publishers.

## **How It Works**
1️⃣ Users input keywords in the search bar.

2️⃣ The system processes input using N-Gram and LSTM models.

3️⃣ Top 10 relevant book titles are displayed, ranked by accuracy.

## **Why It Matters**
This project showcases the power of NLP in improving search functionality, making book discovery faster, smarter, and more user-friendly. 🚀
